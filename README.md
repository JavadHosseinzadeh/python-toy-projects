Python Toy Projects

This repository contains several small projects about Python programs, including threading, serial communication, neural networks, and trading bots. Each project has a series of basic Python programming concepts to be explored and applied in real-world scenarios.

## 1. **Serial Reader**
- **File**: `Serial_Reader.py`
Description: A Python script that reads from a serial port connected with a device, such as a microcontroller or sensor; parses the data; and performs real-time data processing-somewhat useful for hardware interfacing, sensor networks, or IoT applications. The ongoing script keeps listening for data on the serial port and acts accordingly.

## 2. **Threading Example**
- **File**: `thread_example.py`
- **Description**: This project demonstrates how Python's `threading` module can be used to run multiple tasks concurrently. It provides examples of launching, suspending, and stopping threads. This script is directed at the benefits of multi-threading in dealing with tasks that involve waiting on external events (e.g., input/output operations).

## 3. **Trader Bot (Incomplete)**
- **File**: `Trader_bot_not_complete.py`
- **Description**: This is a prototype of a trading bot. A bot that fetches real time stock or cryptocurrency prices, and attempts to make buy or sell decisions based on pre-defined conditions of price thresholds. It is incomplete but can easily be extended with trading strategies, data analysis, or integrating to real trading platforms.

## 4. **Neural Networks Final Questions**
- **Files:**
  - `NN_final_Question_3.ipynb`
  - `NN_final_Question_5_1.ipynb`
  - `NN_final_Question_5_2.ipynb`
- `NN_final_Question_5_3.ipynb`
- **Description**: Exercises in Jupyter notebook related to neural networks. Projects involve modeling, training, and evaluation methodologies. Employed various optimization techniques, activation functions, and neural network architectures for hands-on deep learning and machine learning concepts.
